As has been true in the other courses I have taken with him, his style of presentation is slow and methodical. He demonstrates each tool and technique while clearly describing each as he works. He gives many opportunities to practice each, but encourages students to do more and more of the practice sets to deeply embed these basic skills into place. Section 2, Day 3: Beyond the Box was my favorite and most challenging. I thought I understood how boxes in space respond to perspective, but when I started drawing them myself, I often got confused or just lost in the process. A quick rewind of the lesson helped me find my confusion, correct my image, and then move to another. It took me six or seven times of drawing many boxes before I finally understood and could see how to use the techniques to create boxes in space and in perspective. The ending project is fun to do because he has found a way to put all of the skills in this and his earlier courses to work to produce a satisfying final drawing. There are more courses in this series, and I cannot wait to study more with him!
