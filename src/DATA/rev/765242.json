Throughout my first semester, I really struggled with coding and I'm one of those people who just thought I would never really get it no matter what I tried. However, that all changed over the course of the school year as I learned R on my own and with the help of this course. By the time I was done with my second semester I actually felt pretty competent in R. Not to the point where I can just look at a problem and instantly know how to code it (like some R wizards can do), but to the point where I actually feel comfortable explaining how to do lots of things in R to other people who are just starting and being able to figure out moderately complex problems on my own or with minimal google searching for function syntax.  \n\nThis course was an absolutely critical component of my learning experience. It made me realize that you don't need to memorize everything about R, you just need to understand what tools R gives you and then frame your problem in those terms. Kirill is an excellent teacher and he really gets to the meat of each skill and technique he is trying to show you in each lesson. He doesn't gloss over things, he explains them in basic terms and builds from there. He seems to have a good intuition for what you're thinking as he explains things, too. There were many times where I would be following his lesson and ask myself a question only to have him bring it up a moment later and explain it fully. \n\nIf you do buy his course, I would advise you to do the lessons in chunks and make sure you really get what was taught before moving on to the next ones. Most importantly, go back and reference lessons when needed. I did this countless times and it really helped to reinforce my learning. If I was stuck on a particular part of a problem in real life I would think \"wait, I saw something like this in the tutorials\" and then I would go back and watch that lesson. Every time I did this it helped me to better understand the reasoning behind it instead of just quickly googling an answer that I only half understand.\n\nSo, in summary, this course helped me out tremendously as both a straight up tutorial with applicable content and also as a valuable reference that I could always go back to when needed to ensure I understood why certain functions or methods worked the way they do. I highly recommend this course!","rating":5.0,"created":"2022-07-18T09:28:12-07:00","modified":"2022-07-19T16:16:39-07:00","user_modified":"2022-07-18T09:53:05-07:00","user":{"_class":"user","title":"R G","name":"R","display_name":"R G","image_50x50":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png","initials":"RG","tracking_id":"0oxFkRqfSdSWuJLfl_nBlQ","public_display_name":"R G."},"response":null,"content_html":"<p>I am a statistics graduate student and when I started this course I had zero knowledge about R and coding in general.
