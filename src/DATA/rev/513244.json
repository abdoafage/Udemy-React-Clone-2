I started off with the section about SQL, but I was quickly disappointed when I found out it is very difficult (if not impossible) to do on Mac. Now, it is not the SDS Team's fault that it does not work for Mac, but there was never any mention of this issue in the videos. I found comments from other people dating back 3 years expressing similar thoughts, but no changes have been made. In the section about building and analyzing models, there is a portion where you use Excel to analyze the model we built in Gretl. There are some Excel short-cuts used that were not explained, and it was VERY difficult to complete the tasks without knowing those short cuts. Again, comments from people dating back 3 years express similar ideas, but no actual changes have been made.
