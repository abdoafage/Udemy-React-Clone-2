I have used all of these techniques and find them to be not only helpful, but also powerful evaluation techniques for those times when I am putting something I see on paper which I think is correct and then use one of the measuring tools to show me just how far off I have guessed. I have read some comments from students in other courses who do not want to be bothered with measuring, claiming it is too time consuming and not fun. My experience is just the opposite! With just a few practice sessions, I have easily understood the mechanics of the measuring strategies, and almost automatically reach for them when drawing almost anything. They only take a moment or two to use and adjust a drawing, and I find that I enjoy seeing the measured results which now look correct. I think that contour drawing is next in the sequence, and I know it will be exciting to study!",
