Yes, lines do have a psychology attached to them just as does color, and critical decisions are made in any art project about where, how, and when to use and place lines as well as what characteristics they are to have. These notions are wonderfully explored in this course, especially in the Tactile Line and Atmospherics classes. My favorite is the drawing sequence for a rock. I think they are difficult to draw, and Mr. Eviston demonstrates some strategies that have been helpful and problem-solving for it.
