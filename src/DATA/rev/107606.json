I first took the Simon Sez IT MS Project 2013 Bundle and really enjoyed the course. I learned a great deal from it. Since I liked it so much I decided to try the MS Excel 2013 course. I was quite pleased to find that Toby Arnott was the instructor again as he did a fantastic job with the Project courses. A couple of things to note with this course... \nI have more experience with Excel than I had with Project so much (though by no means all) of what is in the Beginner course is review. Fortunately the Udemy interface allows me to play it at 2x speed to get through it quicker without missing anything interesting. Your brain gets used to the speed pretty quickly and before you know it you don't even notice that it is faster than normal. Similarly, since all MS Office products share the ribbon interface and Office Backstage, most of that is similar to what I saw in the MS Project course. If you are taking several MS Office courses you will see some redundancy but you can speed past it or use it as review. \nAs I got into the advanced portion of the course I found that it went beyond what I typically need to use Excel for. While I need to be able to use some other products such as MS Project or MS OneNote at an advanced level, I’m probably fine with using Excel at an intermediate level. I’m not a statistician or a finance and accounting guy and some of the material was interesting but not something I will typically use in my daily job. That said, for those who need that, I think it was covered well.
