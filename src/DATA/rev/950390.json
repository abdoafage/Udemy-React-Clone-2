Linear, logistic, random forest, naive bayesian...\n- Association Rule\n- Data Clustering: k-means, SVM, \n- Neural Networks\n\nAlmost all content is explained nicely.\nI did miss a lecture for the XGBoost model, or even some pointers to bibliography so I could do the research myself. It was suprising as all other sections do have at least 1 single lecture regarding the theory or concepts behind the topic covered.\n\nSome lectures seem to drag unnecessarily. While I think it's great lecturers take their time to explain key areas and concepts, more than a few times the lecture would get stuck for 5 mins + on some area that was explained at the beginning of the course, not adding anything new.\n\nOverall, I give it 4.5/5.\nThe course is very good. The negative points stand out simply because everything else is so polished. Totally recommended if you have no knowledge of ML or if, just like me, you already have some knowledge of certain areas and wish to expand your skillset AND/OR you already have knowledge of ML in either Python or R and wish to learn the other.\n\nAbout the latter point, my take from the course is that certain parts of ML are much more convenient to implement in R, even if (to my opinion) R is not as straightforward as Python.\n\nAs a final note:\nI'd personally recommend you already have at least some programming experience before taking the course. As I mentioned at the beginning, some parts of the course are slightly out of date. Even if they are up to date, some things may not be as straightforward as shown in the lectures. You may need to correct the code yourself, which will require you to have basic notions of object-oriented programming. You can always check the Q&A for people with the same problem as you (everyone has them at some point), or ask the question yourself if you can't find the answer or would like some more clarifications.\n\nFarewell and, as you will hear time and time again throughout this course should you decide to enroll in it, happy machine learning.","rating":4.5,"created":"2022-07-13T23:26:58-07:00","modified":"2022-07-14T16:09:27-07:00","user_modified":"2022-07-13T23:53:13-07:00","user":{"_class":"user","title":"Gustavo Hylander Ruiz","name":"Gustavo","display_name":"Gustavo Hylander Ruiz","image_50x50":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png","initials":"GH","tracking_id":"j2nrzEYbSE6TzkzZONmpJA","public_display_name":"Gustavo H."},"response":null,"content_html":"<p>The course is very good and broad, exactly what I was looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Pros:<br>- Quick overview of almos all ML fields, with hands-down explanations of the concepts behind them (in all but 1 case - XGBoost)</p>\n\n<p>- Many resources provided, both as downloadable content and references and bibliography content</p>\n\n<p>- There's active instructors in the Q&A section that can help you with issues you may have.</p>\n\n<p>- Almost all content is done in both Python and R (only missing a CNN R implmentation)</p>\n\n<p>Cons:<br>- Some content is slightly out of date, as certain libaries and packages used throughout the course have some differences in their API calls.</p>\n\n<p>- There's some areas I wish were explained in more depth</p>\n\n<p>- Some resources are provided as-is, with no explanation about them (only a few cases)</p>\n\n<p>The course is excellent for a fast dive in ML, covering all main fileds with a variety of techniques:<br>- Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and LDA<br>- Regression & Classification with a handful of approaches.
